* image processing
Even thought that neural networks and machine learning exists as field of study since 1950 or sooner, there was no wider adoption of these techniques in image processing. Research in image processing was adopting predominately bottom up methodologies. Methods that were trying algorithmically describe image by detecting points of interest (e.g edges) in images. And then combine points to patches that were usually descibed by several paramters and these would be. In the first attempts to process image with use of machine learning were exactly these descriptors used as input. In other words complexity of image scenary was simplified to greatly reduce number of information supplied for any learning algorithm. Consequence of this approche is that this image preprocessing eables the deployment of often simple Machine learning algorithms for needs of pattern matching or image classification etc. As it might be obvious this favors simpler models.
