* Frameworks
  There is wide variety of options for machine learning frameworks in general and also for *CNN* specifically.
Namely there is a variety of tools that are centered around python. All of the frameworks bellow have at least some support for GPGPU computation.

** python
    Theano - Optimized and efficient open sourced python library that is widely used for computation with multi-dimensional arrays for thee needs of Machine learning.

    TensorFlow - Open source library developed by Google for numerical computations using data flow graphs.

    keras - High level Neural Network library that can run on top of either TensorFlow or Theano.

** Lua
    Torch - Scientific computing framework with support of wide variety of machine learning algorithms.

** C++
    OpenCV - Library for computer vision and machine learning.

    Caffe - Deep learning framework. Also supports python API.

** Matlab
    MatConvNet - Matlab toolbox implementing CNNs for computer vision application.
