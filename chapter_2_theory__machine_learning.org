** Machine Learning
   It is necessary to properly define machine learning before we move forward. There are many valid definitions that may differ but in this text we will adhere  to the following.
   Field of Machine learning is a subset of \gls{ai} that is describing tools that can be used to solve problems.

   In order to properly explain
We will use a definition from \cite{book--goodfellow--2016}

*** Task

**** Loss function

**** Optimization

*** Supervised Learning
*** Unsupervised Learning
*** Generalization of Machine Learning
